    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "By using this notebook, you can train a TensorFlow Lite model for use on a Raspberry Pi and Google Coral USB Accelerator. We've designed this process to be as simple as possible. If you find an issue with this notebook, please create a new issue report on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/GrantPerkins/CoralSagemaker), where you downloaded this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the WPILIB dataset as a .tar file [here](https://github.com/GrantPerkins/CoralSagemaker/releases/download/v1/WPILib.tar)\n",
    "2. Upload your .tar file to a new folder in an Amazon S3 bucket, or a brand new S3 bucket.\n",
    "3. Create a new SageMaker notebook instance, and open the WPILib notebook.\n",
    "4. Change estimator.fit() in the last code cell to use your new dataset, by specifying the folder in which the tar is stored.\n",
    "5. Run the code block.\n",
    "6. Training should take roughly 10 minutes and cost roughly \\\\$0.55 if using the GPU instance, or 45 minutes and cost roughly \\\\$0.45 if using the CPU instance. If you do not change anything in the notebook, other than the S3 location, it should absolutely not take longer than an hour.\n",
